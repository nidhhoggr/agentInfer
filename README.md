### Inference Engine

* based on an inference engine of modular knowledge based cfomponents.

* the core systems has the inference instructions to address and compute various knowledge based modules.

Some key components of the inference engine:

* State

  - the state is a store of all of the current data being processed. 
  - it promotes context that modules are dependent upon.

* Sense of Environment

  - the default environment is a virtual agent

* Self Actualization

  - the agent should keep memory of its successes and failures and should build upon these

* Randomness

  - although the agent should act consistent it should have a randomness to supply invariability

### Modules

* each knowledge based module has a database and a set of inference instructions

* the modules should be decoupled from the agentc and the inference engine and vice versa.

### Preferred Modules

#### Emotion Module

* identifies emotions and associates them to self actualization, state and sense of environment

* apply emotions to the inference of subscribing modules.

#### Language Module

* should be subscribed to emotion module if it exists.
